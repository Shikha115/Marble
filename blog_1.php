        <p>Marble has always been a timeless beauty. Luxurious in appearance, while marble appears to be a classy material, it is actually economical and easy to maintain with diverse design applications.</p>
        <p>Each marble slab is unique, and when used as a flooring material, it effortlessly creates an unrepeatable design. From a variety of colours available, one can choose the right colour to create and conceptualize the correct setting. For example, natural colours or marble of a fresh colour gives a welcoming ambience to the space. A Table, if designed well, can bring the whole room together and with suitable colour accents, it can make any room look brighter. Marble, with its quality of style and natural striations, creates an eye-catching look. To obtain a soft look in your interiors, use pallid marbles for furniture. If you couldn't take your eye off that dark shade marble and choose to use it for your furniture, use a light-toned interior to elevate the look of the marble. To give a 'decor magazine' look to your space, pair gilded mirrors against your marble. Add marble countertops to your kitchen's interior design; it never fails to make a design statement. With each unique slab, you'll end up with an irreplaceable pattern for your countertop. To incorporate marble into your bathroom design is much less of an inconvenience; one only needs to find the right size and shape of marble and then install it in the place of your choice. It is also a practical way to incorporate a more extravagant trend into your home or add a luxe element to a small apartment.</p>
        <p>Due to its versatility, marble is famous for decor accessories and helps to create a focal point in the space.  Marble adds 'value' to each project, and is a versatile material that all designers love to work with.</p>
