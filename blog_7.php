        <h2>Vocal For Local in <span>Stone Industry</span></h2>
        <img src="src/images/blogs/210113112659_blog_image.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The new hashtag floating around in the modern and national life of commerce and business in India is #VocalForLocal. India, therefore, has shifted its emphasis towards the Made-in-India values at the core of the industry and putting its buying power into the products and services that are made locally.</p>
        <p>From the Prime Minister urging to go vocal for local, to the recent great innovations to help fight the pandemic, all of these have resulted in the Indian stone industry to look within and take the required measures. Motivating the manufacturer to promote local industries and curbing down imports of machinery and raw materials, are some of the steps taken for the growth and strengthening of the economy and provide opportunities by creating more jobs in the sector to help people sustain their livelihood.</p>
        <p>The use of tiles made from locally available materials not only increases the sustainability factor in a project, but also reduces the carbon footprint and the associated pollutants (during transportation). This campaign strengthens the sense of brand-ownership for home-bred innovations and ideas.</p>
        <p>With similar thoughts in mind, A-Class has reinforced its 1st Tile product range of porcelain tiles, which are exquisitely Made in India. Unravelling the strength and beauty of new age materials, A-Class aims to transform the landscape of luxury interiors and architecture in the country by widening the scope of material technology to blend cutting-edge technology with impeccable craftsmanship, nurturing avant-garde ideas that find use in a wide spectrum of building typologies.</p>
        <p>The 1st Tile range is the perfect blend of natural aesthetic and elegance which comes in innovative format of 1200mm x 2400mm with thickness of 9mm and 6mm. These tiles are a perfect answer to effective and time saving engineering solutions available in honed finish. Tiles like Terra Beige, Earthy Bronze, Caramel, Deep Ebony and Pebble Stone are ideal options for both interior as well as exterior spaces due to its light weight, crack free, flexible and anti- bending nature.</p>
        <p>Therefore, going local for stones not only goes a long way in terms of encouraging local industries, creating job opportunities, or strengthening the economy, but also being sensitive towards our environment and making smart choices for our projects.</p>
