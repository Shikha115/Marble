       <p>As the year comes to an end, Festive cheer and New Year celebrations are at peak. At A-Class Marble, we bring you some tips and tricks to revamp your spaces and add a touch of luxury and stylistic grandeur this festive season.</p>
       <h3>Accessorize with Marble</h3>
       <p>Adding marble accessories such as dinner sets or bathroom accessories are a great way to incorporate marble into interior spaces. These accessories not only add opulence to a room, but are an elegant way to accentuate any corner. Pairing a marble dinner set with tasteful quartzite or marble dining table, offers a fresh take on the minimalist, yet modern Scandi design trend.</p>
       <h3>Dynamism through Textures</h3>
       <p>Add a sense of dynamism and variability to spaces by placing contrasting textures such as metallic or solid matte around marble textures. By pairing marble with luxurious textures such as gilded gold edging using brass is a definitive way to add glamour to spaces effortlessly. Mundane spaces can be transformed by using this technique with alluring marble furniture as well as accessories such as marble trays and elegant vases that beautifully marry the two textures.</p>
       <h3>Marble Walls</h3>
       <p>Marble or Exotic stones can be used on walls to create stylistic backdrops either covering the whole wall or creatively occupying parts of it. This design trick could be applied to spaces of every scale ranging from minimalist home interiors to large industrial spaces. The variety of colours, textures and vein details offer great choices to create stunning backdrops and add grandeur to spaces.</p>
       <h3>Sculpting in Style</h3>
       <p>Marble offers excellent versatility and can be sculpted into stylistic pieces such as statement lighting or tableware of varying scales and designs. These can be used to accentuate any spaces in your home, ranging from the bedrooms to the bathrooms.</p>
       <h3>Marble for the Outdoors</h3>
       <p>Marble or Stone is a great material that can be used for outdoor or semi-open spaces. Using marble pieces such as marble planters or stylistic elements are a great way to add some style as well as definition to gardens, balconies or even window sills. Incorporating marble pieces into mosaics on walls or seatings, instead of tiles could be a luxurious alternative.</p>
       <p>Marble is one of the most versatile material, and with our luxurious collection of uniquely sourced international marbles, creating festive spaces is just a few steps away.</p>
