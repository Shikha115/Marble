        <img src="src/images/blogs/210331133036_blog_image.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Marble has been the go-to choice for public buildings since time immemorial. Not only does it add a luxurious finish to spaces, but it has also often been associated with monumentality and historicity. Even in todayâ€™s context, we often find large commercial and hospitality spaces layered with marble. Ever wondered what makes marble the go-to choice for such buildings?</p>
        <p>Read on to know why:</p>
        <h3>1. Easy to clean</h3>
        <p>Marble is often used as a flooring material and rightly so, as it is effortless to clean. A few swipes of a cloth occasionally keep the marble squeaky clean requiring minimal maintenance and time.</p>
        <h3>2. Available in lots of colours</h3>
        <p>Marble is available in a wide variety of colours and textures, making it an easy addition to any design scheme. It also opens up the possibility of variability and highlights within the same space. Since marble is also extremely versatile, its use can be extended to wall finishes and accessories.</p>
        <h3>3. Durable</h3>
        <p>Marble is one of the most durable addition one can do to their space. It can withstand any items being dragged across or small falls on to its surface. As long as marble is well maintained, it can remain scratch less through high traffic areas like lobbies and gathering spaces.</p>
        <h3>4. Joints are easy to match</h3>
        <p>Since commercial spaces are generally large in scale, it is essential to match joints to create a seamless effect. The marble joints can easily be checked by skilled labour on-site, making the installation process smooth and hassle-free.</p>
        <h3>5. Easy to customize</h3>
        <p>Marble being extremely versatile and easy to customize, can be assigned any role within your spaces. Corner details, custom inlays, patterned installations, all can be achieved with great ease.</p>
        <p>Naturally occurring marbles can also be an eco-friendly choice for large spaces that have larger carbon footprints. Therefore marble is a great tool to add luxury, functionality and efficiency to your commercial spaces and is a go-to choice for large buildings with significant human traffic.</p>
